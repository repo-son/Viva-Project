# Viva-Project
I have uploaded the Visual studio .sln File with this.
You can download it and add to your IDE.
Ask viraj for the database .bacpak FIle. He will give it to you.
Add .bacpac file to ms sql and create the connection to the database by updating the connection string in the visual studio.
Then continue the work from there. Add your ideas to the project.
Thank you..
